<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">
  Unless you live under a rock (or really, really do not care), you&#8217;ve probably noticed that a big part of Mitt Romney&#8217;s platform is cutting government spending. Obama, according to Romney, has driven the United States into a <a href="http://mittromney.tumblr.com/post/26596198800/president-obama-promised-to-cut-spending-but">precarious financial position</a> through irresponsible spending. Therefore, Romney has said that if he is elected president, he will make a “<a href="http://www.mittromney.com/collection/smaller-smarter-simpler-government">smaller, simpler, smarter government</a>” by <strong>capping government spending at <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/issues/spending">20%</a> of the gross domestic product (GDP).</strong>
</p>

There are two parts to this story. First of all, how much did Obama, whose first-term spending has been widely called exorbitant, really burn up during his first term? And what programs will the Government have to shed to reach Romney’s financial goals?

&nbsp;

_Obama’s Spending_

&nbsp;

“Since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history, taking us from an already staggering $3.5 trillion in federal spending in 2010 to a projected $5.6 trillion within the next decade&#8230; even as federal spending remains wholly within our control, Washington is spending money in an out-of-control fashion.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Obama’s spending has been a point of contention since the first bailout bill passed, and Romney said on numerous occasions that Obama “[doubled](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7408732n)” the national debt. Naturally, fact-checkers have jumped all over the claims.

&nbsp;

As it turns out, Obama can be blamed for some, but not all, of the jump in federal spending. [FactCheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/http://www.factcheck.org/) (a neutral fact-based website) chalks up the increase to a combination of factors, including Obama and President Bush&#8217;s policies and a [5.8%](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/obamas-spending-inferno-or-not/) cost of living increase. Bush signed several very expensive bills just before Obama took office, including a [$700 billion](http://thinkbynumbers.org/?p=2571) bailout bill which Obama later reduced to $475 billion. The big federal spending hike came in [2009](http://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2012/06/Federal_Spending_and_Receipts_GDP.png), one year into Obama&#8217;s first term; FactCheck says that Obama can be held responsible for up to [$203 billion](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/obamas-spending-inferno-or-not/), or 38%, of the $535 billion increase.

&nbsp;

So, no, Obama is not single-handedly responsible for the national debt, although he isn’t completely guiltless either. Here’s what he did [spend](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/10/everything-obama-has-done-and-wants-to-do-on-taxes-in-one-post/) money on:

&nbsp;

[Stimulus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Stimulus_Act_of_2008): Meant to boost the sagging employment rate and provide tax cuts. Upfront cost is $787 billion, [$831 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009) by 2019.

&nbsp;

[The Affordable Care Act](http://www.cbo.gov/topics/health-care/affordable-care-act): Health care reform to make it easier for people to get insurance. Cost is estimated to be [$1,131 billion](http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12119/03-30-healthcarelegislation.pdf) by 2021.

&nbsp;

[2010 Tax Deal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Relief,_Unemployment_Insurance_Reauthorization,_and_Job_Creation_Act_of_2010): Extension of Bush-era income tax cuts through 2012. Cost is estimated to be around [$860 billion](http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/07/news/economy/tax_cut_deal_obama/index.htm).

_Romney’s Cuts_

A lot of [critics](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-13/mitt-romney-and-the-fantasy-budget) complain that while Romney says he wants to make big cuts, he has yet to explain exactly how. His [website](http://www.mittromney.com/issues/spending) highlights a plan that involves spending cuts across the board with the exception of defense &#8211; Romney has said on record that he wants to increase core defense spending to [4%](http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/romney-defense-spending/index.htm) GDP. He also says he will ‘[repeal and replace](http://www.mittromney.com/issues/health-care)’ the Affordable Care Act; cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, and foreign aid; reduce federal workers by [10%](http://www.mittromney.com/issues/spending); and give States more power.

&nbsp;

Analysts predict that even with Romney’s planned cuts, making cuts to get spending to 20% GDP while increasing defense spending to 4% GDP is going to hurt. According to a recent release by the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3658), Romney’s proposed GDP budget cuts would result in astronomical cuts to healthcare and low-income aid programs.

&nbsp;

First of all, estimates say that repealing the Affordable Care Act **would cause [30 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Impact) **

<img data-attachment-id="2504" data-permalink="https://thinkbynumbers.org/?attachment_id=2504" data-orig-file="https://thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impact.png" data-orig-size="180,162" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Impact" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impact.png" data-large-file="https://thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impact.png" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2504" title="Impact" src="http://thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impact.png" alt="" width="180" height="162" /> 

**Americans to lose ****their health insurance**. Romney has said that he wants to [give states back regulatory power](http://www.mittromney.com/issues/health-care) over health care, which may dampen this number slightly. However, those with pre-existing conditions and low income will likely be in serious trouble.

&nbsp;

Even with the elimination of the Affordable Care Act, Romney will have to [**cut government programs by 32% by 2016**](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3658) in order to not cut into Medicare, according to the CBPP study. _Medicaid and Children’s Medicaid would cut [$1.9 trillion](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3658) by 2022_, causing an additional **[14-19 million](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3658) people to lose their health insurance**. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which offers low-income individuals and families help with getting healthy food, would **drop [10 to 14 million](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3658) people** and reduce benefits for those still covered. Disabled and elderly veterans, entitled to $13,000 and $11,000 per year respectively, would have their **benefits cut by [up to a third](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3658)**, while SSI benefits for elderly and disabled persons would dip even lower than the current annual [$6000](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3658) stipend. See the chart below for specifics.

&nbsp;

Would doing all of this help balance the budget? Certainly. But is it worth the cost? That is one of the issues voters will have to weigh as Election Day nears.
