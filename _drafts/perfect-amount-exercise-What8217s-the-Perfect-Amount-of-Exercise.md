Exercising sucks.  It&#8217;s work and takes time away from more enjoyable activities like playing Legos.  However, for many, it&#8217;s necessary to stave off depression and maximize energy levels.  Also,for those of you who like being alive, it reduces the likelihood of an early death.  But there&#8217;s a point at which the opportunity cost of another minute of exercise exceeds the benefit of that minute of exercise.

New <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/187402.php" target="_blank">research</a> from the UK suggests that just five minutes of &#8220;green&#8221; exercise a day benefits people&#8217;s mood, self-esteem and mental health: in fact they found this small dose produced the largest positive effect.

In their calculations they looked at the links between two types of dose response: intensity and duration of activity, and two types of mental health indicators: scores on mood and self-esteem.

The biggest effect was seen in just 5 minutes of activity:

&#8220;The overall effect size for improved self-esteem was d = 0.46 (CI 0.34-0.59, p < 0.00001) and for mood d = 0.54 (CI 0.38-0.69, p < 0.00001).&#8221;

&#8220;Dose responses for both intensity and duration showed large benefits from short engagements in green exercise, and then diminishing but still positive returns,&#8221; they wrote.

It appears the effect was even greater in the presence of water, such as a lake, stream or pond, so perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the most beneficial environment is a blue and green one.

When they looked at age, the authors found the greatest improvement in self-esteem was in the youngest participants, and diminished with age, while for mood the smallest change was in the young and old.

The modern lifestyle is a radical departure from the one in which we evolved. Though scholars disagree on the relative amount of time that our hunter-gatherer ancestors spent running versus walking, the evidence suggests that they covered a lot of ground either way: 10 to 20 kilometers a day walking among men, says professor of biological anthropology Richard Wrangham, &#8220;and about half that for women. Chimpanzees, by comparison, walk only 2 to 4 kilometers a day, and all other apes walk even less.

How much exercise is enough? Some controversy remains about the optimal amount and intensity of exercise required to reap protective benefits against cardiovascular disease. &#8220;Some people say you need to do vigorous exercise in order to achieve the benefits,&#8221; explains Hu. &#8220;Others have said that, no matter what kind of exercise you do, if you have the same amount of energy expenditure, you will get the same benefit.&#8221; Hu thinks that both are probably right. &#8220;For the majority of Americans, it is probably not very useful to distinguish moderate- from vigorous-intensity exercise; the highest priority is simply to increase their energy expenditure. No matter what they do,&#8221; he says, &#8220;it is better than sitting on the couch.&#8221;

But people who already exercise can probably reap additional benefit by increasing the intensity of their activity. &#8220;We have found that among men, the intensity itself can give you additional cardiovascular protection above and beyond the total amount of exercise you do,&#8221; Hu says. Vigorous aerobic exercise may be best at burning visceral fat, the metabolically active intra-abdominal adipose tissue that the liver draws on for energy when other fuel sources run low. Fat is not just an energy reserve, researchers have learned in recent years. It can produce and regulate hormones that cause inflammation of the cardiovascular system. Any exercise that gets rid of visceral fat will improve health.

And the optimal amount of exercise? Early studies suggested that when you reached a certain amount of activity, your benefit would plateau. &#8220;Our data so far don’t support this assumption or hypothesis,&#8221; says Hu. &#8220;Basically, the more the better. There is a straight dose-response relationship in both men and women. For preventing heart disease and stroke,&#8221; he says, &#8220;there is no limit to the benefits of exercise.&#8221;

While the need for exercise is cut-and-dried, the question of how much you need is far hazier. Experts are constantly changing it up. First you need 30 minutes three times a week. Then you need 60 minutes every day. The fact is, there&#8217;s no way most of us are going to get an hour a day, seven days a week. Most of us aren&#8217;t even up for 20 minutes of huffing and puffing.

But you don&#8217;t need to run a [marathon](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/marathon.htm) to benefit your [heart](http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/life/human-biology/heart.htm). Studies show that even minimal exercise, as little of 10 minutes of [walking](http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/diet-fitness/exercise/benefits-of-walking.htm)each day, can do great things. In 2007, researchers at Louisiana State University found that overweight women who started exercising &#8212; just walking at a relaxed pace &#8212; about 70 minutes a week increased their hearts&#8217; oxygen consumption by more than 4 percent [source:[Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501426.html)]. Oxygen consumption is a sign of your heart&#8217;s health.

That&#8217;s definitely the low end, though. The more time you spend exercising, the greater the benefits. In that same study, the women who exercised about 30 minutes a day increased their heart&#8217;s oxygen consumption by more than 8 percent.

&nbsp;

Twenty minutes of aerobic exercise, three or four times a week, at moderate exertion will get you significant benefits [source: [MedicineNet](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey)]. Moderate exertion is when your pulse and breathing rate increase, but you can still talk comfortably &#8212; you&#8217;re not out of breath. Jogging and jumping rope are good examples. On the higher end, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends 30 minutes a day with only a couple of days off each week, or about 150 minutes per week. For someone who doesn&#8217;t love exercise but is looking to significantly benefit his or her heart, the ideal amount is probably somewhere in between: 30 minutes a day at least three days a week. At 90 minutes a week &#8212; and it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter whether you do 30 minutes at a time or two 15-minute sessions a day &#8212; you can help your heart get stronger, provide more oxygen to your cells, lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol numbers. It&#8217;s a manageable amount of activity, too, so it&#8217;s easier for people to maintain, which is key to getting the heart benefits you&#8217;re after.

The question of how much exercise is enough gains special piquancy at this time of year, when many of us dust off last year’s New Year’s resolutions and promise to be more diligent about working out in the coming year. Unfortunately, figuring out an ideal exercise dosage is not simple, in part because the amount of exercise needed depends on the benefits you hope to gain. Twenty minutes a week of vacuuming or other activity may, according to the Scottish study, increase your contentment, but it certainly won’t do much for your cardiovascular fitness and is unlikely to lessen your risks for a multitude of diseases and, ultimately, of premature death, benefits that a greater amount of exercise may provide. It also won’t help much with weight loss. That said, anyone resolving to increase the amount of housecleaning they do in the New Year is welcome to begin their regimen at my home.

In general, a wide reading of the latest sports science makes it clear that the “amount of physical activity necessary to produce health benefits cannot yet be identified with a high degree of precision,” according to the authors of the[2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans report](http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/default.aspx), which was produced by the Department of Health and Human Services and was based on the recommendations of an advisory committee scientists. These experts waded through dozens of studies on the health effects of exercise, looking at the impacts that exercise can have on people’s risks for heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, depression and, in general, premature death. In some studies that were cited, exercise actually seemed to confer little if any disease-fighting benefits. In others, the benefits kicked in only if the exercise was quite strenuous; in yet others, a gentle stroll a few times a week was enough to lessen the risk of early death.

Despite the inconsistent results, caused in some part by even more inconsistent methodologies between the different studies, the advisory committee did ultimately reach some conclusions about how much — or, really, how little — exercise we each should be doing. That minimum amount of exercise required to see a significant lowering of your risk of dying prematurely was, they concluded, 500 MET minutes of exercise a week. Of course, unless you’re an exercise scientist, there’s a good chance you don’t know what a MET minute is. A single MET, or Metabolic Equivalent of Task, is the amount of energy a person uses at rest. Two METs represent twice the energy burned at rest; four METs, four times the energy used at rest; and so on. Walking at three miles per hour is a 3.3-MET activity, while running at 6 miles an hour is a 10-MET activity. The committee concluded that a person needs to accumulate a weekly minimum of 500 MET minutes of exercise, which does not mean 500 minutes of exercise. Instead, 150 minutes a week (two and a half hours) of a moderate, three- to five-MET activity, such as walking, works out to be about 500 MET minutes. Half as much time (an hour and 15 minutes per week) spent on a 6-plus MET activity like easy jogging seems, according to the committee, to have similar health effects.

Interestingly, they did not find that exercise beyond a certain point conferred significant additional health benefits. Instead, the “dose response” for exercise, the committee found, is “curvilinear.” In other words, people who are the least active to start with get the most health benefit from starting to exercise. People who already are fit don’t necessarily get a big additional health benefit from adding more workout time to their regimens. Which is not to say that if you are, for instance, a devoted runner or cyclist, you should reduce your workout time in 2010 to 500 MET minutes per week. You’re already well ahead in terms of health benefits. According to the Physical Activity Guidelines report, “It has been estimated that people who are physically active for approximately seven hours a week have a 40 percent lower risk of dying early than those who are active for less than 30 minutes a week.”
