  For the last 30 years every presidential state of the union address has included the same theme, “We need to end our dependence on foreign oil.”  The reasons are many, but the surge in Islamic anti-Americanism has highlighted this need like never before. The simple fact is that we are funding both sides in the so-called war on terrorism.  You might say it sounds so crazy it just might work.  But in that case, you might live in the park yelling at pigeons and accusing them of being spies for the KGB.

American taxpayers are obviously funding our side of this conflict by maintaining the largest military budget in the world.  This exceeds the expenditures of the militaries of the next top [17](http://www.warresisters.org/pages/piechart.htm) spending countries combined.

What might not be so obvious is that American petroleum consumers are funding the anti-American Islamic threat as well.  A fraction of what we spend at the pump goes to fund corrupt dictatorial regimes in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and many others.  In these countries the ruling parties make themselves filthy rich by keeping the preponderance of the oil revenue for themselves .  This is done while the majority of the population maintains a standard of living well below the poverty line.  Although this is a hilarious joke to play upon your populace, oddly enough, it does inspire resentment towards these rulers.

In order to avoid being overthrown through a popular uprising, these regimes redirect this resentment… towards the US.   This is done through the funding of madrasas, Islamic religious schools, which indoctrinate the youth from a very young age to despise the west and recognize MTV and Coca-Cola as the cause of all evil in the world.  These madrasas are the incubation chambers for terrorism.

Many of these governments have also been linked to funding of actual terrorist operations.  It’s pretty expensive to fund terrorist training camps and all of the actual logistical necessities of carrying out attacks.  Flight lessons, airline tickets, and the production of the film Legally Blonde 2 are some very familiar examples. [[HAC2]](file:///C:/Users/Mike/Documents/Literary%20Ideas/Fool%20Consumption.doc#_msocom_2)

How do we solve this problem?  President Bush seems to think the solution lies in giving speeches stating the obvious, as if we’re a nation of six-year-olds, while taking no meaningful action.  Yet, for decades, every year we’ve heard the same speeches, and every year our net foreign oil imports have grown.  It is insanity to continue the same ineffective course of action and expect a different result.

Right now, the average “at the pump” cost of gasoline is $2.10[[HAC3]](file:///C:/Users/Mike/Documents/Literary%20Ideas/Fool%20Consumption.doc#_msocom_3) /gallon.  However, this is not the actual cost of gasoline.  The true cost must incorporate the fees incurred by:

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    Using our military to prop up cooperative, dictatorial regimes in oil-rich countries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Military expenditures to secure and protect the oil as it is shipped to theUS.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combating the terrorist threat which is funded be the theocratic regimes from which we buy the oil.
  </li>
  <li>
    And corporate welfare to the fossil fuel industry.
  </li>
</ol>

Not to mention the immeasurable costs of the life each serviceman lost in this pursuit, the potential catastrophic consequences of global warming, or the pain caused by the knowledge that you are facilitating the ability of Dick Cheney to swim in a pool filled with gold doubloons every night.

After including these quantifiable factors, the National Defense Council Foundation, a conservative think-tank, estimates that, the actual cost of unleaded gasoline is about $5/gallon.  Since you’re only paying $2/gallon, who’s paying the other $3?  You are.  It comes out of your paycheck before you ever see it.  It’s derived from income taxes.  So, in the minds of most Americans, this money never even existed, much like the possibility of an honest politician.

The solution to our dependence on foreign oil doesn’t require any military action.  The solution doesn’t require any tax increases to create new energy related government bureaucracies.  To the contrary, it involves an income tax rebate.  We should give tax payers back this $3,000/year the federal government spends on the aforementioned indirect costs of fossil fuels.  Then, we could simply shift those costs to a direct federal sales tax upon gasoline.  If you maintained identical transit behavior, you would still have just as much money left over as you had before. You would just have to fork over the money at the gas station instead of it being subtracted from your wages. However, if you chose a more energy-efficient form of transportation, you could save hundreds to thousands of dollars a year.  If you still wanted to continue funding terrorism and corporate welfare to the oil industry, you could do this through a direct personal monetary contribution.[[HAC5]](file:///C:/Users/Mike/Documents/Literary%20Ideas/Fool%20Consumption.doc#_msocom_5)

Instantly, alternative sources of energy (hydrogen fuel cells, hybrid-electric, methanol, ethanol, oxen, etc.) would become far more available because they would no longer have to compete with the artificially low cost of oil.

Until consumers realize the true cost of gasoline, no number of presidential speeches will ever put an end toAmerica’s masochist consumption of fossil fuels, unless we all start taking hot air balloons to work.

## How to Fund Terrorism Without Having to Deal with a Messy FBI Investigation

&nbsp;<article>Gas Prices Surge to Over $5 a Gallon</p> 

&nbsp;

For the last 30 years every presidential state of the union address has included the same theme, &#8220;We need to end our dependence on foreign oil.&#8221;  The reasons are many, but the recent surge in Islamic anti-Americanism has highlighted this need like never before. The simple fact is that we are funding both sides in the so-called war on terrorism.  You might say it sounds so crazy it just might work.  But in that case, you might live in the park yelling at pigeons and accusing them of being spies for the KGB.

&nbsp;

Anyway, American taxpayers are obviously funding our side of this conflict by maintaining the largest military budget in the world at a cost of nearly half a trillion dollars a year.  I know that doesn&#8217;t seem like much, but a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon we&#8217;re talking real money. This exceeds the expenditures of the militaries of the next top 18 spending countries combined.

&nbsp;

American petroleum consumers are funding the anti-American Islamic threat as well.  A fraction of what we spend at the pump goes to corrupt dictatorial regimes in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, Syria and many others.  In these countries the ruling parties make themselves filthy rich by keeping the preponderance of the oil revenue for themselves. This is done while the majority of the populace maintains a standard of living well below the poverty line.  Although this is a hilarious joke to play upon your population, oddly enough, it does inspire resentment.

&nbsp;

In order to prevent themselves from being overthrown through a popular uprising, these regimes redirect this resentment towards the US.   This is accomplished through the funding of madrasas, Islamic religious schools, which indoctrinate the youth from a very young age to despise the west and recognize MTV, McDonalds, and mini-skirts as the root of all evil in the world.  These madrasas are the incubation chambers for terrorism.

&nbsp;

Members of many of these governments have also been linked to funding of actual terrorist operations.  It&#8217;s pretty expensive to fund terrorist training camps and all of the actual logistical necessities of carrying out attacks.  Flight lessons, airline tickets, and the production of the film Legally Blonde 2 are some very familiar examples.

&nbsp;

How do we solve this problem?  President Bush seems to think the solution lies in giving speeches stating the obvious, as if we&#8217;re a nation of six-year-olds, while taking no meaningful action.  Yet, for decades, every year we&#8217;ve heard the same speeches, and every year our net foreign oil imports have grown.  It is insanity to continue the same ineffective course of action and expect a different result.

&nbsp;

Right now, the average &#8220;at the pump&#8221; cost of gasoline is $2.24/gallon.  However, this is not the actual cost of gasoline.

&nbsp;

The true cost must incorporate the fees incurred by:

  1. Using our military to prop up cooperative, dictatorial regimes in oil-rich countries.
  2. Military expenditures to secure and protect the oil as it is shipped to the US.
  3. Combating the terrorist threat which is funded be the theocratic regimes from which we buy the oil.
  4. Corporate welfare to the fossil fuel industry (to the tune of $15 billion this year).

Not to mention the immeasurable costs of the life each serviceman lost in this pursuit or the potential catastrophic consequences of global warming.

&nbsp;

After including these quantifiable factors, the National Defense Council Foundation, a conservative think-tank, estimates that, the actual cost of unleaded gasoline is about $5/gallon.  Since you&#8217;re only paying around $2/gallon, who&#8217;s paying the other $3?  You are.  It comes out of your paycheck before you ever see it.  It&#8217;s derived from income taxes.  So, in the minds of most Americans, this money never even existed.

&nbsp;

The solution to our dependence on foreign oil doesn&#8217;t require any military action.  The solution doesn&#8217;t require any tax increases to create new energy related government bureaucracies.  To the contrary, it involves an income tax rebate.  We should give tax payers back this $3,000/year the federal government spends on the aforementioned indirect costs of fossil fuels.  Then, we could simply shift those costs to a direct federal sales tax upon gasoline.  If you maintained identical transit behavior, you would still have just as much money left over as you had before.

&nbsp;

Instantly, alternative sources of energy (hydrogen fuel cells, hybrid-electric, methanol, ethanol, oxen, etc.) would become far more available because they would no longer have to compete with the artificially low cost of oil. It&#8217;s ironic that the so-called &#8220;free market&#8221; conservatives in power are the ones who are handcuffing the invisible hand of capitalism by letting government decide what form of energy should be dominant.  Until consumers realize the true cost of gasoline, no number of presidential speeches will ever put an end to America&#8217;s masochist consumption of fossil fuels, unless we all start taking hot air balloons to work.</article>
