All progress is initiated by challenging current conceptions, and executed by supplanting existing institutions. Consequently, the first condition of progress is the removal of censorship.” ― [George Bernard Shaw](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5217.George_Bernard_Shaw)

I generally focus on taking the log out of my own country&#8217;s eye before complaining about the specks in the eyes of our neighbors. Given the amount of lumber to extract, that&#8217;s a pretty big job. Fortunately, our Founding Fathers were at least kind enough to remove the log from our collective mouth by giving us the priceless gift known as the 1st Amendment. Unfortunately, a very personal tragedy has made it brutally clear that many other countries have not been so fortunate.

<a href="https://www.tinywp.in/about/" target="_blank">Pothi Kalimuthu</a>, the systems administrator for Think by Numbers, has made a lot of sacrifices in his effort to realize a vision of a world without suffering. Pothi was helping us create QuantiModo, a platform to change the landscape of clinical research. Together, we were working to integrate all the data from the world’s life-tracking applications and devices to identify hidden root causes, and determine new treatments for chronic illnesses which inflict immeasurable suffering on hundreds of millions of people.

On July 24th, 2014, Pothi disappeared. After some investigative Googling, today I discovered that he has been [arrested](http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Techie-in-Trouble-for-Aiding-Blogger-over-Savukku/2014/07/25/article2347486.ece) by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of Chennai, India on the charge of hosting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savukku" target="_blank">Savukku</a>, a non-profit, journalistic Indian website. Savukku was known for whistle-blowing articles on bribery and political corruption in India.

Please share this message with anyone who appreciates our duty to use our gift of freedom of speech to speak for those who cannot. If you have a few minutes, please call or email the <a href="http://www.hcmadras.tn.nic.in/contactus.htm" target="_blank">Madras High Court</a> and tell them to free Pothi Kalimuthu, so that he may continue this important work to help the millions who continue to endure lives characterized by the quiet desperation that is chronic illness. He is our friend, and whether you know it yet or not, he is your friend, too. Please help us as we try to help him in this difficult and unjust situation. Thank you for anything you’re willing to do.

Reporters without Borders recognizes that freedom of information is the foundation of any democracy. They are working like hell to provide that foundation to the half of the world’s population that is still denied it. Here is the data from their 2014 World Press Freedom Index. I encourage everyone to check out their site and get involved.

> The 2014 World Press Freedom Index spotlights the negative impact of conflicts on freedom of information and its protagonists. The ranking of some countries has also been affected by a tendency to interpret national security needs in an overly broad and abusive manner to the detriment of the right to inform and be informed. This trend constitutes a growing threat worldwide and is even endangering freedom of information in countries regarded as democracies. Finland tops the index for the fourth year running, closely followed by Netherlands and Norway, like last year. At the other end of the index, the last three positions are again held by Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea, three countries where freedom of information is non-existent. Despite occasional turbulence in the past year, these countries continue to be news and information black holes and living hells for the journalists who inhabit them. This year’s index covers 180 countries, one more than last year. The new entry, Belize, has been assigned an enviable position (29th). Cases of violence against journalists are rare in Belize but there were some problems: defamation suits involving demands for large amounts in damages, national security restrictions on implementation of the Freedom of Information Act and sometimes unfair management of broadcast frequencies. <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 21px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff;"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br /> </span></span>
