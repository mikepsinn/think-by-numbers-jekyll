  We all know that health care is good to have – how else would you be able to afford to get all of those warts frozen off? However, getting health care can be tricky business if you happen to have a pre-existing condition. If you’ve got one, you are already well aware of this. If you don’t and you think you’ll go back to reading about Miley Cyrus’s new haircut because clearly this does not affect you, swallow this: <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/resources/reports/preexisting.html">19-50%</a> of non-elderly Americans have a pre-existing condition, and of those people, up to <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/resources/reports/preexisting.html">20%</a> are uninsured.

  Still think it doesn’t affect you? One of the most common pre-existing conditions is cancer, and <a href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2010/05/06/41-percent-of-Americans-will-get-cancer/UPI-75711273192042/">41% </a>of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point. Other <a href="http://healthinsurance.about.com/od/healthinsurancebasics/a/preexisting_conditions_overview.htm">common pre-existing conditions</a> include type-2 diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. So even if you are lucky enough to get off scott-free, chances are someone you know and love won’t. So even if you do not have a pre-existing condition, this does affect you. Sorry to be depressing.

**Obamacare and Pre-Existing Conditions**

Anyway, pre-existing conditions are a hot topic nowadays because, not only do they hit close to home, they are a highlight of the 2010 [Affordable Care Act](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/index.html) (affectionately, or not so affectionately, known as Obamacare). The Affordable Care Act’s [Pre-Existing Conditions Insurance Plan](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/choices/pre-existing-condition-insurance-plan/index.html) provides state or federally subsidized insurance plans for people with pre-existing conditions. Of course, this is very expensive, which is why a lot of people want to dismantle Obamacare. But while it still stands, those with pre-existing conditions are in luck.

Its also stipulates that [kids](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/rights/childrens-pre-existing-conditions/index.html) under 19 years of age with pre-existing conditions cannot be refused coverage by their parent’s health care provider. So little Jimmy is guaranteed coverage under Mommy and Daddy’s plan, even if he has a rare pre-existing condition that causes him to spout spider webs from his wrists and stick to walls. Starting in [2014](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/choices/pre-existing-condition-insurance-plan/index.html), adult Spidermen and Spiderwomen will also be guaranteed coverage by their chosen healthcare providers.

**How To Get It**

&nbsp;

Here’s how to get you some health insurance if you have a pre-existing condition.

&nbsp;

1. Check with your parents. Under the [Young Adult Coverage](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/choices/young-adult-coverage/index.html) clause of Obamacare, parents can keep their offspring ages 25 and younger on their health insurance plans. Depending on the severity of your condition, you may be able to get health insurance this way – fo free. So if you are under 26, look into it before you go on to the next step.

&nbsp;

2. Make sure you qualify. Applicants have to be legal U.S. residents who have a) not had insurance for six months or more and b) have a pre-existing condition and/or been denied insurance for health reasons. If you have been insured in the past six months and are desperate for insurance, try applying to other insurance companies. If you are denied, your foot is in the door for PCIP.

&nbsp;

3. Apply. Under PCIP, there are two kinds of coverage: state and federal. The state you live in determines which one you are eligible for. See the handy-dandy [map](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/choices/pre-existing-condition-insurance-plan/index.html#state) on the PCIP page to determine which one you can get. State applications vary, so if you live in a state with such coverage, click on that state on the map for helpful info on what coverage is available and where/how you can apply.

&nbsp;

If you qualify for the federal program, the prices still vary somewhat depending on your state, but the application is streamlined. Find out how to apply [here](https://pcip.gov/How_to_Apply.html).
