******The Government, Fed and Big Banks: A Profitable Bailout  
In March 2011, Bloomberg LP [secured a court order](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-21/fed-must-release-bank-loan-data-as-high-court-rejects-appeal.html) forcing the Federal Reserve to reveal details on its trillion dollar emergency loan bailout of Wall Street, including the names of which corporations were benefiting. The [documents showed](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/secret-fed-loans-undisclosed-to-congress-gave-banks-13-billion-in-income.html) that the Federal Reserve has given below-market rate loans to major banks and encouraged them to loan the money back to the Treasury at higher rates, thus subsidizing their investment. Wall Street has gone on to use some of this profit to increase their investment in Washington, via lobbyists and political donations.  
[Bloomberg&#8217;s report](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/secret-fed-loans-undisclosed-to-congress-gave-banks-13-billion-in-income.html) did not consider the full extent of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s [more than dozen lending programs](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/02/04/business/20090205-bailout-totals-graphic.html) which the Government Accountability Office (GAO) audited to be [$16 trillion](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/GAO%20Fed%20Investigation.pdf). Instead, they examined the aggregate $7.77 trillion provided to Wall Street, as of March 2009, in emergency loans, guarantees and lending limits to [a broad range](http://projects.propublica.org/tables/treasury-facilities-loans) of major banks, brokerage firms and other companies during the credit crisis.  
The Fed’s huge bailout occurred alongside the Treasury-administered $700 billion so-called [Troubled Asset Relief Program](http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/tarpinfo.htm) (TARP) bailout (now capped at $475 billion). For two years the Federal Reserve and the major banks and brokers [fought to keep](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/the-clearing-house-assn-l-l-c-v-bloomberg-l-p/) the names of those on the &#8216;other&#8217; scheme secret, even from Congress, who were [legislating financial reforms.](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:a_vjZtho34UJ:banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf+dodds+frank&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShBmQggpwFOg8NzT3gCae9ORBSpWWK2zdYdZDI6edzy1KjUKVeXJwwac) However, the Fed’s forced disclosure finally revealed the extent and the ‘faces’ of the bailout. On the banks&#8217; most desperate day, Dec. 5 2008, $1.2 trillion was consumed. Even as the banks were receiving these massive loans, they were [publishing to market notices of their strength and stability](http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/bank_notes/2011/11/bloomberg-bank-of-america-received.html).  
The biggest beneficiaries of the secret deal were the so-called &#8220;Big Six&#8221;, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who took 63% of the Fed&#8217;s offering, as measured by peak daily borrowing. These loans were made at interest rates of between 0.1 and 0.25%. The banks were then encouraged to buy US Treasury bills that could pay as much as 1% interest. According to Bloomberg&#8217;s figures, this amounted to a cash transfer of $13 billion by the Federal Reserve to the major banks.  
Using this cash injection, the banks were able to continue [practice of risky investments](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/16/banks-risky-loans-bailout_n_963887.html) to enhance profits. Between 2006 and 2011, the six biggest US banks boosted [their asset values](http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/top50form.aspx) by 39%, from $6.8 trillion to $9.5 trillion. In 2010, bank executive pay in the US and Europe [jumped 36%](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bb5b697a-95a6-11e0-8f82-00144feab49a.html#axzz1nuNxg6ED).  
Lobbying investment also rose dramatically. The big six spent [$29.4 million](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=F07&year=a) on lobbyists, up 33% from 2006. Meanwhile, political donating reached new heights in 2011-12, when elite donors from the finance/insurance/real estate sector (FIRE) provided political campaigns with [$182.5 million](http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/sectors.php). The major aim of such political influence buying has been [to fight proposals](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jan/24/wall-street-lobbyists-banks-obama) for financial reform.

However, they argue that the public has been the main beneficiary through the stabilizing of the vital banking system. The price paid has been over $13 billion in public money sacrificed to Wall Street, a denial of democratic choice and the creation of the ‘<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/21/us-usa-bailout-watchdog-idUSTRE59K0UQ20091021">moral hazard</a>’ that financial bad practice will be perpetuated by the lucrative government safety net.<br /> </strong>
