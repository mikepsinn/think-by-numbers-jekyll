> Workers with depression reported significantly more total health-related lost productive time (LPT) than those without depression (mean, 5.6 h/wk vs an expected 1.5 h/wk, respectively). Eighty-one percent of the LPT costs are explained by reduced performance while at work. Major depression accounts for 48% of the LPT among those with depression, again with a majority of the cost explained by reduced performance while at work. Self-reported use of antidepressants in the previous 12 months among those with depression was low (<33%) and the mean reported treatment effectiveness was only moderate. Extrapolation of these survey results and self-reported annual incomes to the population of US workers suggests that US workers with depression employed in the previous week cost employers an estimated 44 billion dollars per year in LPT, an excess of 31 billion dollars per year compared with peers without depression. This estimate does not include labor costs associated with short- and long-term disability.
> 
> #### CONCLUSIONS:
> 
> A majority of the LPT costs that employers face from employee depression is invisible and explained by reduced performance while at work. Use of treatments for depression appears to be relatively low. The combined LPT burden among those with depression and the low level of treatment suggests that there may be cost-effective opportunities for improving depression-related outcomes in the US workforce.

# What is Mental Illness: Mental Illness Facts

Mental illnesses are medical conditions that disrupt a person&#8217;s thinking, feeling, mood, ability to relate to others and daily functioning. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illnesses are medical conditions that often result in a diminished capacity for coping with the ordinary demands of life.

Serious mental illnesses include major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality disorder. The good news about mental illness is that recovery is possible.

Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age, race, religion, or income. Mental illnesses are not the result of personal weakness, lack of character or poor upbringing. Mental illnesses are treatable. Most people diagnosed with a serious mental illness can experience relief from their symptoms by actively participating in an individual treatment plan.

In addition to medication treatment, psychosocial treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, peer support groups and other community services can also be components of a treatment plan and that assist with recovery. The availability of transportation, diet, exercise, sleep, friends and meaningful paid or volunteer activities contribute to overall health and wellness, including mental illness recovery.

## Here are some important facts about mental illness and recovery:

  * Mental illnesses are serious medical illnesses. They cannot be overcome through &#8220;will power&#8221; and are not related to a person&#8217;s &#8220;character&#8221; or intelligence. Mental illness falls along a continuum of severity. Even though mental illness is widespread in the population, the main burden of illness is concentrated in a much smaller proportion-about 6 percent, or 1 in 17 Americans-who live with a serious mental illness. The National Institute of Mental Health reports that One in four adults-approximately 57.7 million Americans-experience a mental health disorder in a given year
  * The U.S. Surgeon General reports that 10 percent of children and adolescents in the United States suffer from serious emotional and mental disorders that cause significant functional impairment in their day-to-day lives at home, in school and with peers.
  * The World Health Organization has reported that four of the 10 leading causes of disability in the US and other developed countries are mental disorders. By 2020, Major Depressive illness will be the leading cause of disability in the world for women and children.
  * Mental illness usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, often during adolescence and young adulthood. All ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable.
  * Without treatment the consequences of mental illness for the individual and society are staggering: unnecessary disability, unemployment, substance abuse, homelessness, inappropriate incarceration, suicide and wasted lives; The economic cost of untreated mental illness is more than 100 billion dollars each year in the United States.
  * The best treatments for serious mental illnesses today are highly effective; between 70 and 90 percent of individuals have significant reduction of symptoms and improved quality of life with a combination of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments and supports.
  * With appropriate effective medication and a wide range of services tailored to their needs, most people who live with serious mental illnesses can significantly reduce the impact of their illness and find a satisfying measure of achievement and independence. A key concept is to develop expertise in developing strategies to manage the illness process.
  * Early identification and treatment is of vital importance; By ensuring access to the treatment and recovery supports that are proven effective, recovery is accelerated and the further harm related to the course of illness is minimized.
  * Stigma erodes confidence that mental disorders are real, treatable health conditions. We have allowed stigma and a now unwarranted sense of hopelessness to erect attitudinal, structural and financial barriers to effective treatment and recovery. It is time to take these barriers down.

According to a _U.S.A. Today_ report, based on research by Harvard University Medical School, untreated mental illness costs the U.S. a minimum of $105 billion in lost productivity each year. Most organizations’ health coverage plans show that physical ailments are covered, while mental health problems lag far behind. Serious mental illnesses costs society almost $200 billion in lost earnings per year according to the_American Journal of Psychiatry._

Ronald Kessler, a Harvard University professor of health care policy and lead author of a study of the National Institute of Mental Health, cites data that shows 60% of Americans with a mental disorder get no treatment.

# The Neglect of Mental Illness Exacts a Huge Toll, Human and Economic

<p id="articleDek">
  By letting mental afflictions go untreated, we consign millions of Americans to misery and put a drag on our economy

  <p>
    Mental health care is one of the biggest unmet needs of our time. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2011/a0901_adult_mental_Illness.html">Nearly one in two people in the U.S.</a> will suffer from <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/topic.cfm?id=depression">depression</a>, anxiety disorders or another<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/topic.cfm?id=mental-health">mental health</a> ailment at some point in their life, and about one in 17 Americans currently has a serious mental illness.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Millions of people living with these conditions do not receive the care they require. In recent years the health system and state and federal governments have taken steps to right that wrong. Progress has been slow, and budget cuts and legal wrangling have now put many of these measures at risk. Doctors, insurers and politicians need to pick up the pace.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Mental illness strikes without regard for economic class, but the strain is acute for people with low incomes. About one in six adults living at just above the poverty line or lower <a href="http://www.kff.org/healthreform/8187.cfm">has severe mental health problems</a>. Without access to affordable treatment, many have a hard time holding down a job yet do not qualify as formally disabled, thus leaving them locked out from insurance coverage. <a href="http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/pubs/Publication.aspx?pubID=529">A recent large study in California</a>found that only 32 percent of uninsured residents with mental illnesses received any treatment at all and that less than 12 percent got adequate help.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The human and economic toll is enormous yet often hidden. Untreated mental illnesses in the U.S. cost more than $100 billion a year in lost productivity, <a href="http://www.nami.org/template.cfm?section=about_mental_illness">according to the</a><a href="http://www.nami.org/">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> (NAMI). Local hospitals and clinics must cope with associated chronic physical diseases. Schools have to open more special education classes. Courts and jails handle a large number of individuals who suffer from untreated mental illnesses. Suicide ranks among the top 15 most common killers in the U.S. (in the top three among young people), and 90 percent of cases can be attributed to mental illness.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The severity of the problem has prodded politicians into action. By 2002, 29 states had mandated that health insurance packages cover mental illness on the same terms as physical illness, and in those states the suicide rate fell by an average of 5 percent. But equalizing coverage means little to those who lack insurance altogether, and states are increasingly failing to make provision for them. In the past three years states have cut up to 39 percent of their mental health budgets, <a href="http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=state_budget_cuts_report">according to NAMI</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama<a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html">signed into law</a> in 2010, should help fill these holes. It requires that insurance plans offer “behavioral health” coverage, including mental health and addiction and substance abuse help, as an “essential health benefit.” At least 3.7 million Americans who are currently living with severe mental illness will get new benefits for their conditions by 2014, either through extended Medicaid coverage or insurance exchanges.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yet these measures are in legal jeopardy. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments for and against the constitutionality of the act late in March. If the court rules that states do not have to expand their Medicaid programs, as the act currently requires, it could shut out 16 million Americans who would otherwise receive Medicaid coverage for mental health. A ruling that closes the state insurance exchanges would deprive another 16 million. Scuttling the law would also do away with plans to build national centers for the treatment of depression and to improve the way behavioral health services are integrated into standard care.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the law falls, Congress must reinstitute its most crucial provisions, and even if it stands we all have more to do. Insurance alone does not guarantee that people get the care they need; doctors and social workers must work to ensure that. Drug companies must refill the research pipeline for new drugs, which has been sorely neglected [see “<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=lifting-the-black-cloud" target="_blank">Lifting the Black Cloud</a>,” by Robin Marantz Henig, on page 66], and develop other treatments. And all of us should get over the stigma we still tend to attach to these conditions. The rewards will be that millions of our friends, neighbors and children will have a chance to become healthier, happier and more productive members of society.
