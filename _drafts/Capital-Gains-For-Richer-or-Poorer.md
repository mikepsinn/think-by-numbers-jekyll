A quick lesson in economics: a [capital asset](http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409.html) is anything that you own. Your home, your car, your investments, even your vintage model car collection is considered a capital asset. When you sell a capital asset, the difference between the amount you paid for it and the amount you sold it for is considered a [**capital gain**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gain) or a [**capital loss**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_loss).

The IRS taxes long-term (held for over a year) and short-term capital gains differently. Short-term capital gains are taxed just like income, at rates of [10-35%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States) depending on income level. However, long-term capital gains are only taxed at [15%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States) (get more details on this [here](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Ten-Important-Facts-About-Capital-Gains-and-Losses)).

While this does benefit the middle class where real estate or other property is concerned, the principal beneficiaries sit squarely in the well-to-do sector. The 15% tax rate on long-term capital gains means that the upper economic tiers of the population can sell valuable capital assets and pay 20% less in taxes on their earnings than they would otherwise. This is a huge incentive for the wealthy to stock up on valuable property, hold it for over a year, then sell it for a profit to ensure Uncle Sam only gets a relatively small slice of the pie.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities published a [report](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3837) in September 2012 on how raising the long-term capital gains tax could bolster the economy and help reduce the financial gap between the middle class and the rich. The report states that [71%](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3837) of all capital gains go to the top 1% of taxpayers; the top 0.1%, it says, saves about [$356,700](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3837) per year because of the low rate, while the middle class saves around [$23](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3837) per year. Another [study](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42131.pdf), done internally by the Congressional Research Service, found that regressive economy – promoted by the capital gains tax – widened the income gap in the late 1990s and early 2000s and may have contributed to the Great Recession.
