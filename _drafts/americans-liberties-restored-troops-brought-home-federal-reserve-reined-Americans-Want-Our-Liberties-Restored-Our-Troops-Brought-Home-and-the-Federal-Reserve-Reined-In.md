    Preface: This essay is not intended as an endorsement (or non-endorsement) of Ron Paul. Rather, it is intended to demonstrate why Ron Paul is becoming so popular, despite being virtually ignored by the mainstream media. Had Obama followed the American people’s wishes – as revealed by the poll numbers cited below – he would easily win re-election.

  <h3>
    Americans: Rein In the Federal Reserve
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    CNN <a title="notes" href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/27/rep-ron-paul-the-country-is-ripe-for-revolution/" target="_blank">notes</a>:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “We are seeing a level of enthusiasm for Ron Paul that can be compared with President Obama in 2008″, said Eric Brakey, Media Coordinator for NYC Liberty HQ, the grassroots organization hosting the rally for the candidate. “Congressman Paul’s youth support is different now than it was during his last presidential campaign. It’s more organized and it’s picking up steam and continues to grow”.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As the longtime congressman from Texas stepped onto the stage, the crowd screamed with enthusiasm. The audience’s biggest reaction came when he spoke about ending the Federal Reserve. “The country has changed in the last four years, but my message hasn’t changed” Paul said. “The country is ripe for a true revolution”.

    At least <a title="75% of the American people want a full audit of the Fed" href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/december_2010/americans_still_strongly_favor_audit_of_the_fed" target="_blank">75% of the American people want a full audit of the Fed</a>, and <a title="most were against reconfirming Bernanke" href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/november_2009/just_21_favor_bernanke_s_reappointment_as_fed_chairman" target="_blank">most were against reconfirming Bernanke</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Indeed, as Bloomberg <a title="noted" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-09/more-than-half-of-americans-want-fed-reined-in-or-abolished.html" target="_blank">noted</a> last December:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      A majority of Americans are dissatisfied with the nation’s independent central bank, saying the U.S. Federal Reserve should either be brought under tighter political control or abolished outright, a poll shows.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      ***
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Americans across the political spectrum say the Fed shouldn’t retain its current structure of independence. Asked if the central bank should be more accountable to Congress, left independent or abolished entirely, 39 percent said it should be held more accountable and 16 percent that it should be abolished. Only 37 percent favor the status quo.

    As I have extensively <a title="documented" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/06/bernanke-is-either-not-very-bright-or-not-very-honest-he-admits-he-doesnt-know-why-we-have-a-weak-economy-but-hes-the-one-who-weakened-it.html">documented</a>, the Fed is largely responsible for the economic crisis, and has failed to meet a single one of its stated mandates (let alone its <a title="implied ones" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/epic-failure-feds-price-stability-mandate-treasury-curve-shift-most-abnormal-30-years" target="_blank">implied ones</a>).

  <h3>
    Americans Are Sick and Tired of Never-Ending War
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Ron Paul is also gaining popularity because he is against the never-ending War On Terror, and wants to bring the troops home. Americans are sick of the never-ending, ever-creeping war. See <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/03/poll-most-americans-strongly-oppose-u-s-intervention-in-arab-countries.html">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/15/134559832/poll-shows-64-percent-of-americans-saying-afghan-war-not-worth-it" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/09/iraq.poll/index.html" target="_blank">this</a>.

    As Talking Points Memo <a title="reported" href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/pew-americans-disagree-that-wars-in-iraq-afghanistan-have-lessened-the-chance-of-another-terror-atta.php" target="_blank">reported</a> earlier this month:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “…Only about a quarter say the wars in Iraq (26%) and Afghanistan (25%) have lessened the chances of terrorist attacks in the United States,” the Pew report reads. “In both cases majorities say the wars either have increased the risk of terrorism in this country or made no difference.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Top American military leaders agree, saying that <a title="the war on terror has weakened our national security" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/04/four-stories-this-week-prove-that-the-war-on-terror-is-a-farce.html">the war on terror has weakened our national security</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Americans Want Our Liberties Back
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Mr. Paul also speaks alot about the importance of liberty.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And Americans have become much less tolerant of the wholesale destruction of our constitutional freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      On the eve of the ten year anniversary of 9/11, the Pew Research Center <a title="has released new data" href="http://people-press.org/files/legacy-questionnaires/Sept.%2011%20topline%20for%20release.pdf" target="_blank">has released new data</a> on Americans’ reaction to the attacks, and the foreign and national security policies pursued in the post 9/11 era. They show a country with views that have evolved on the relationship between civil liberties and the tools given to government to fight terrorism, and a disbelief that the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan helped to lessen the chance there will be another terrorist attack on the United States.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Pew survey showed a large shift in the number of Americans who are willing to see some of their civil liberties go out the window in the name of fighting terrorism. Directly after 9/11, Americans were willing to make the deal, as 55 percent thought it was necessary, against 35 percent who felt the opposite. Now, only 40 percent felt that giving up some civil liberties is necessary to curb terrorism, with 54 percent against.
