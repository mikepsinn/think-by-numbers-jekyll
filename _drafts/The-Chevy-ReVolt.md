  The <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/volt-electric-car.html">Chevrolet Volt</a>, Chevy’s groundbreaking plug-in hybrid, was supposed to change the way we drive. Instead, it has been attracting negative attention since the get-go, much of which can be attributed to the tax subsidies and other cuts available for the car. A year ago, reports surfaced that each Volt cost taxpayers <a href="http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/16192">$250,000</a>. Now, there are suggestions that Chevy loses nearly <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2012/09/10/stunner-gm-may-be-losing-50000-on-each-chevrolet-volt/">$50,000</a> for every Volt it sells. Now, people are even more upset because of the Pentagon’s decision to purchase a fleet of the vehicles. How did one little car become the subject of so much controversy?

**The $250,000-Taxpayer Subsidized Car?**

&nbsp;

Let’s start with the [$250,000](http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/16192)-per-car debacle. That number was generated by James Hohman at the [Mackinac Center of Public Policy](http://www.mackinac.org/) in Mackinac, Michigan in 2011. Hohman, sources indicate, added up all of the federal and state subsidies, loans, rebates and other deals available for the car, which totaled [$3 billion](http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/16192). He then divided by the 6,000 Volts that had sold at the time, arriving at the conclusion that each Volt qualifies for between [$50,000-$250,000](http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/16192) in subsidies.

&nbsp;

Within the report, Hohman acknowledges that many of the subsidies were contingent upon reaching certain goals, so the full amount would likely remain unattainable. He also told the press that Chevy would continue to sell Volts and that the cost per vehicle for taxpayers would fall. Indeed, [24,345](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt) Volts had been sold through September 2012, bringing the maximum per-car taxpayer cost by Hohman’s logic to $12,323 and falling.

&nbsp;

However, none of this stopped the media from pouncing on the number. December 2011 headlines from one news outlet include “[Each Chevy Volt Costs Taxpayers $250,000](http://nation.foxnews.com/chevy-volt/2011/12/22/each-chevy-volt-costs-taxpayers-250000)” and “[Report: Chevy Volt Costing Taxpayers Up To $250K Per Vehicle](http://nation.foxnews.com/chevy-volt/2011/12/21/report-chevy-volt-costing-taxpayers-250k-vehicle).” This has continued into 2012, with a blogger on the same outlet writing an entry entitled “[Media Fail: Chevy Volt Makes NO Money, Costs Taxpayers Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars Per Car](http://nation.foxnews.com/chevy-volt/2012/07/17/media-fail-chevy-volt-makes-no-money-costs-taxpayers-hundreds-thousands-dollars-car).” The post went live in mid-July, well after Hohman’s numbers could be considered at all viable.

&nbsp;

**Chevy’s Financial Woes?**

&nbsp;

Controversy #2 erupted very recently, when Reuters released a report stating that each Volt sold may cost Chevy up to [$50,000](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-generalmotors-autos-volt-idUSBRE88904J20120910) a year. The [release](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-generalmotors-autos-volt-idUSBRE88904J20120910) states that each Volt costs [$76,000-$88,000](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-generalmotors-autos-volt-idUSBRE88904J20120910) to build. Since the car costs about [$39,990](http://www.chevrolet.com/volt-electric-car.html) to purchase and lease prices as cheap as [$200](http://www.plugincars.com/2012-chevy-volt-lease-rate-hits-rock-bottom-price-199-month-124128.html) a month, Reuters states that GM is absorbing significant losses.

&nbsp;

[GM says](http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Sep/0910_volt.html) the numbers are “grossly wrong” and “become more wrong with each Volt sold.” Chevy is counting on the investment of the research involved in the Volt paying off as the car continues to sell. It also cites that Volt sales have started to [take off](http://www.autospies.com/news/Hybrid-Sales-Jump-73-7-In-October-Diesel-Sales-Rise-21-2-For-Month-73251/) in the U.S. this fall, making a future profit more and more tangible.

&nbsp;

Naturally, the media was [all over the story](http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/09/10/gm-denys-report-it-is-losing-4g-on-each-volt-sold-while-admitting-program-is/). It fused the findings with the Pentagon’s decision to purchase [1,500](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/11/taxpayers-to-get-charged-as-pentagon-buys-up-chevy-volts/) electric cars, including Volts, saying that the government was backing the car at taxpayer expense.

&nbsp;

At this rate, the tirade on the Volt will likely continue until Chevy can drive its sales and profits up enough to quell the public. It is undeniably true that the Volt is [losing](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/09/GM-denies-losses-of-49000-on-every-Chevrolet-Volt-70000080/chevrolet-volt/70000080/1#.UJGYyGl26kY) Chevy money, but the media suggests that this is typical for most cars featuring new technology – the investments ends up paying off in the long run. Only time will tell if it pays off for the Volt.
