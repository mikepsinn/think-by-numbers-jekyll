## Prioritize Your To-Do List By Converting To PresentÂ Value

There is an infinite number of ways you can spend your most valuable resource, time. How can you decide what the most cost-effective way to spend your time is? By converting the returns of each activity to its present value and picking the activity with the highest present value.

I live in a house that's bigger than I need and farther away from my job than I'd like. So I'd like to sell it and get a smaller apartment closer to work. However, this comes with a great cost. Assuming a sale price of $200,000, here are the typical costs of selling a house.

It's also going to take a lot of time. In order to do apples to apples comparisons, we need to convert this time to a monetary value. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American worker makes [$27/hour](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t19.htm).

Moving closer to my job will save me 2 hours per week (an equivalent of $54 in weekly earnings).
